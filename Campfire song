I call this one the "Campfire Song Song"
Let's gather around the campfire
And sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along

Bom, bom, bom

C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster, then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
Patrick!
Song! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E
Squidward!
Good!

It'll help
It'll help
If you just sing along!
Oh yeah!
