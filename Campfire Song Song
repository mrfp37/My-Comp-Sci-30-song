I call this one, the campfire song song
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Bum, bum, buuum...

And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along

Patrick!
Song! C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E
Squidward!
Gooood!
It'll help, it'll help...
If you just sing along!
Aww, yeah!
